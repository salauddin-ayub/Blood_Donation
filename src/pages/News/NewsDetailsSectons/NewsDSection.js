              The slogan for 2023 World Blood Donor Day campaign, celebrated on
              14 June 2023, is “Give blood, give plasma, share life, share
              often.” It focuses on patients requiring life-long transfusion
              support and underlines the role every single person can play, by
              giving the valuable gift of blood or plasma. It also highlights
              the importance of giving blood or plasma regularly to create a
              safe and sustainable supply of blood and blood products that can
              be always available, all over the world, so that all patients in
              need can receive timely treatment.

              In many countries, blood services face the challenge of making
              sufficient blood available, while also ensuring its quality and
              safety. Lack access to safe blood and blood products – especially
              in low- and middle-income countries, impacts on all patients,
              including those requiring regular transfusion. One of WHO
              strategies is to assist low- and middle-income countries in
              improving the availability and quality of human plasma, including
              optimizing the utilization of the plasma recovered from whole
              blood donations, and increasing patients’ access to the
              life-saving plasma protein therapies.

              Activities that would help promote the slogan of this year’s World
              Blood Donor Day may include donor appreciation ceremonies, social
              networking campaigns, special media broadcasts, social media posts
              featuring individual blood donors with the slogan, meetings and
              workshops, musical and artistic events to thank blood donors, and
              coloring the iconic monuments red or yellow. Countries are
              encouraged to disseminate to various media outlets stories of
              people, in particular transfusion-dependent patients, whose lives
              have been saved through blood or plasma donation as a way of
              motivating blood and plasma donation.
